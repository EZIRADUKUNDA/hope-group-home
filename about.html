  <h2>About Our Home</h2>
  <p>HOPE GROUP HOME is a small residential home care setting committed to providing compassionate support for individuals who cannot live alone. Our mission is to ensure each resident feels safe, respected and empowered to live as independently as possible.</p>
  <p>Group‑home care is a type of care given to a group of people within a communal residence. It provides custodial and skilled support in a home‑like environment. Residents share common spaces while receiving the assistance they need to carry out daily living activities.</p>
  <p>At HOPE GROUP HOME, we take a person‑centered approach to care. Each resident’s care plan is tailored to their specific goals, needs and abilities. We believe that independence and community involvement are vital for quality of life, and we work with residents to create opportunities for socialization, skill‑building and meaningful activities.</p>
  <h3>Our Values</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Compassion:</strong> Providing care with empathy and kindness.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect:</strong> Honoring each person’s dignity and choices.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Working with families, healthcare providers and the community to support our residents.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Maintaining high standards of professionalism and transparency.</li>
